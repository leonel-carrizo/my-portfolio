# My Personal Portfolio

![portfolio_demo](assets/portfolio_demo.gif) ## Project Description

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, a web application designed to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information. Built using **Vite** for a fast development experience, the site leverages core web technologies like **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with **Sass** for more efficient styling.

### Technologies Used

* **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development experience.
* **JavaScript (JSX)**: The core programming language for dynamic interactions and component-like structures.
* **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
* **CSS**: Used for styling the web application.
* **Sass**: A powerful CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
* **Neovim**: The text editor used for development, highlighting my preferred development environment.
* **Git/GitHub**: Version control and hosting.
